# Road-Accident-Analysis
Project Description

Road safety is a critical issue affecting communities worldwide. To address this, I have created a Road Accident Analytics Dashboardâ€”an Excel-based tool designed to analyze and visualize road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. This dashboard provides stakeholders with valuable insights to make data-driven decisions and pave the way towards safer roads.

Requirements and KPIs

The client aims to create a road accident dashboard for 2021 and 2022, providing insights on the following aspects:

Primary KPIs: Total Casualties and Total Accidents for the current year, along with YoY growth.
Primary KPIs: Total Casualties by Accident Severity for the current year, along with YoY growth.
Secondary KPIs: Total Casualties by Vehicle Type for the current year.
Monthly trend comparison of casualties for the current and previous year.
Casualties by Road Type for the current year.
Current Year Casualties by Area/Location and by Day/Night.
Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location.
Data Sourcing

The dataset can be found [here](insert link).

Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage involved getting acquainted with the dataset and addressing any data quality issues:

Checking for NULL values, blanks, and errors.
Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns.
Ensuring data consistency and cleanliness regarding data types, formats, and values.
Creating new attributes 'Year' and 'Month' for easier interpretation.
Data Analysis

A "Data Analysis" sheet was created to summarize pivot table data, facilitating ease of use for new users, developers, or clients. Nine pivot tables were generated to identify trends, focusing on the relationship between casualties and factors like casualty type, vehicle type, road type, and location. Monthly trends were analyzed for both years.

Data Visualization

The dashboard was created by inserting and customizing pivot charts from the pivot tables. Slicers, timelines, hyperlinks, and connections were added for a user-friendly and interactive experience.

Key Insights

Total Casualties Analysis: The dashboard reveals a total of 417,883 casualties over the two-year period.
Peak Months: Casualties were slightly higher in 2021 than in 2022, with peaks in October and November, and lows in January and February.
Casualties by Vehicle Type: Car accidents accounted for 79.8% of casualties, with minimal casualties involving other vehicle types.
Casualties by Accident Severity: Slight severity casualties formed 84.1% of the total, while fatal severity casualties were 1.7%.
Road Type Analysis: The highest number of casualties occurred on single carriageway roads (310.1K), and the lowest on slip roads (5.1K).
Casualties by Road Surface: 67% of casualties occurred on dry road surfaces.
Casualties by Area/Location: Urban areas accounted for 61% of casualties.
Casualties by Light Condition: 73% of casualties occurred in daylight conditions.
Recommendations Based on the Analysis

Peak Months: Traffic authorities should focus safety measures during high-risk periods in October and November.
Vehicle Type: Awareness campaigns and strict monitoring for car drivers.
Road Type: Enhance safety measures on single carriageway roads and upgrade to double lanes where possible.
Road Surface: Prioritize road maintenance and surface improvements.
Urban Areas: Implement targeted interventions to improve road safety in urban areas, especially during daytime.
Conclusion

This Road Accident Analytics Dashboard facilitates data-driven decision-making, enabling stakeholders to implement evidence-based interventions that enhance road safety. It serves as a valuable tool for policymakers, traffic authorities, and safety advocates alike.
